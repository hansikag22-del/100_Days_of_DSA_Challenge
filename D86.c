/*Problem: Find the integer square root of a given non-negative integer using Binary Search. The integer square root of a number is defined as the greatest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.

Input:
- First line: an integer n

Output:
- Print the integer square root of n

Examples:
Input:
64

Output:
8

Input:
20

Output:
4

Input:
1

Output:
1

Explanation:
Binary Search is applied on the range 0 to n. At each step, the middle value is squared and compared with n. If mid * mid equals n, mid is the square root. If mid * mid is less than n, search continues in the right half; otherwise, in the left half. The final answer is the largest integer whose square does not exceed n.

    int left = 0, right = n;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Use long long to avoid overflow
        long long square = (long long)mid * mid;

        if (square == n) {
            ans = mid;
            break;
        }
        else if (square < n) {
            ans = mid;        // possible answer
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
